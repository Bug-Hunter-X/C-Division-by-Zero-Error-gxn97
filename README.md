# C Division by Zero Error
This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in C: division by zero. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version.

**Problem:**
The original code attempts to divide an integer (`a`) by zero (`b`), leading to undefined behavior and typically a program crash.  Division by zero is a fundamental programming error that needs careful attention.
